# Syntaxtual: Your Intelligent Code Companion

Syntaxtual is a revolutionary Visual Studio Code extension that transforms your coding experience by providing codebase-wide context and intelligent suggestions. Unlike traditional code assistants, Syntaxtual sees and understands your entire codebase at once, offering insights that are truly holistic and context-aware.

## Key Features

- **Codebase-Wide Vision**: Syntaxtual analyzes your entire project simultaneously, providing suggestions and insights based on a comprehensive understanding of your code architecture and dependencies.

- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Leveraging advanced AI techniques, Syntaxtual offers intelligent code suggestions that go beyond simple autocomplete. It evaluates your syntax, programming form, and adherence to standards across your entire codebase.
